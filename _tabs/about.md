# Helloo

I'm Rizki Roihan Soeharto, currently working as a Technical Product Specialist at [Berca](https://www.berca.co.id). As TPS, my main role is to give advice, recommendations, and solutions to the products I'm currently handling, which are primarily Check Point and VMware as secondary. So for the most part, my daily activities will interact with Check Point project-related, but sometimes also VMware.

I've known computers since 5th grade elementary school, and since then I fall in love with computers. Back then I was playing games every day, from local online games to international players games via Steam. This gaming experience actually became my gateway to learning English, which has served me well throughout my career.

A pivotal moment came in junior high school, I got a laptop my first laptop from my mom, a low-budget laptop, but I have a great memory with it. From installing high-end games to mini-experiments and other script kidies can imagine. This hands-on exploration proved to be an invaluable learning experience that helped shape my technical foundation. I learned a lot from that phase.

Thank you from me if you read from the beginning until this line. Your interest means a lot to me. Thank you once again.
